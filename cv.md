##About myself
Through all my life I have been very ambitious and persistent. Starting from school olympiads my hard work has led me Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. And even while studying at one of the best belarusian IT universities I am still eager of something new and I always find a subject for self-studying.
I'm very passionate about Frontend Development. It has all started when I was at school. I had taken some short HTML&CSS course and after that I understood that I like that sort of activity. I like Frontend because it amazes me how I can create things people will use out of nothing. 
And I believe that my technical and interpersonal skills, my love to self-studying will help me to create something even more amazing.

```
int persistence(long long n){
 if (n / 10 == 0) {
   return 0;
 }

  long long next = 1;
  int counter = 1;
  while (n) {
    next *= n % 10;
    n /= 10;
  }
  
  return counter + persistence(next);
}
